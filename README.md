# Trevor Bland's Portfolio
Code which contains images and content detailing my previous works, as well as my own image :)

## Why I chose to make this a public repository
The repository was made public for future employers and others looking to create a web-portfolio. I hope the code is legible, but comments will be included in the final draft and potentially to commits leading up to the final draft.
